# LIBFT
#### My very first own library
## Summary
#### This project aims to code a C library regrouping usual functions that you'll be use for all your next projects.
## Introduction
#### C programming can be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful standard functions. This project allows you to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you with all your future C projects. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year. But always, make sure to check which functions are allowed !

나의 첫 라이브러리를 만드는 프로젝트.  
앞으로 계속 쓰일 라이브러리인 만큼 최대한 신경써서 완벽히 만들어야 후에 문제가 발생하지 않을 수 있다.
